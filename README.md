# Sej Engine

Sej \[ˈsɛj\].

`Sej Engine` or simply `sej` is an performance oriented 3D renderer. It is written in TypeScript and uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/). It is designed to be used as a starting-off point for 3D projects.

The goal of `Sej` is to be both powerful and flexible.

## WIP

Sej is still a work in progress. It is not ready for production use.
